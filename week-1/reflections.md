### 1.1 Think About Time

I  found Counter-intuitive productivity to speak the loudest to me.  I have ADD and am left handed, just like the author, so I could relate.  I used some of the things he talked about, without actually being aware. Or better yet, I had never put my strategy into words. Some strategies I will be implementing are

1.Starting small

"Focus on doing two minutes of important work on whatever it is you want to do. Set a timer and just do two minutes. Anyone can do two freaking minutes."

2. Get in sync with my flow.  Cycles over roboticism.

"Remember, we come from nature and are born from seasons. This means that weâ€™ll naturally cycle inward and naturally cycle back outward. Sometimes we will feel drawn to reflect, meditate and grow internally with no outward signs of productivity or results. And sometimes we will feel an inescapable urge to create, shine and radiate our gifts uncontrollably to the world."

This will be helpful as I always think big, get overwhelmed, and stuck in analysis paralysis. Using this, and meditation, will be my recipe for success.  Meditation has been quite useful for me over the years, along with yoga/exercise/sauna.  These things help my mind stay focused and not jump from an incomplete task.
### 1.2 The Command Line

What is a shell? What is "bash?"



A shell is a program that provides the traditional, text-only user interface. It  is an interface between the user and the internal parts of the operating system.  On systems with GUIs, many users rarely interact with the shell directly. However, GUIs are merely front ends for shells



What was the most challenging for you in going through this material?

I am fairly familiar with the command line, and so far this is pretty basic for me.  It is always good to review.  I had never seen or used the touch command.  The hardest part of using the command line, is the focus it requires, no back button!



Were you able to successfully use all of the commands?



Yes, all the commands are pretty basic



In your opinion, what are the most important commands and arguments to know?



Being able to move around, find and edit files. so mv, cd, grep, less. Also knowing all the shortcuts, i.e. tab tab and others.



Can you remember what each of the following does of the top of your head? Write what each does.



 1.pwd = stands for present working directory. It is the     directory that you are currently in.

ls = outputs list of whats in the current directory
mv = moves or renames a file
cd = changes directory
../ = moves back a directory
touch = creates new files or updates their timestamps if used with certain options
mkdir = creates a new directory
less = built in editor. used to open files with the Less editor
rmdir= remove directory
rm = removes files or directories
help = displays further explanation
