Describe what open source means.
Open source means that all the code is available for anyone to see, use and modify. The opposite of open
source would be code that is trademarked or copyrighted, and can only be used with the owners consent.
What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
I love open source, and I feel it is the only way to go. I am for anything that facilitates progress.
Assess the importance of using licenses.
This gives anyone desiring to use your code an understanding as to how he should and shouldn't use the software.

What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
I am still wrapping my head around using github. I do not feel like I have it down completely, and I am unsure
of specifics at times.  For instance, if I am on a branch, and have commited 3 times, then push/ and merge
into the master, are the commits gone? I have to play around with it some more to get the hang of it.
Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
